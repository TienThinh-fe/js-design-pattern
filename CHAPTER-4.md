# Chapter 4: Anti-Patterns

### What is Anti-Pattern?
- An antipattern is like a pattern but it doesn't give the solution even though it gives complexity
- Bad solution

### Anti-Patterns in JS
- Polluting the global namespace by defining numerous variables in the global context.
- Passing strings rather than functions to either `setTimeout` or `setInterval`
- Using JavaScript in an inline form, as this is inflexible.
